# MicroArchitecture Verication Center @ Nazarbayev Univeristy

This is the website of our academic research group at Nazarbayev University.

This website is powered by Jekyll and some Bootstrap, Bootwatch. We tried to make it simple yet adaptable, so that it is easy for you to use it as a template. Plese feel free to copy and modify for your own purposes.  You don't have to link to us or mention us (but of course we appreciate it).

The website was borrowed from Allan Lab @ Leiden University.
